            <h3>Definitions</h3>
            <p>
                The following Terms and Conditions document is a legal agreement between Arrow Media, hereafter
                'the Developer', and 'the Client' for the purposes of website design or development. These Terms and
                Conditions set forth the provisions under which the Client may use the services supplied.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Developer is an Internet web design provider offering the Client graphical design, HTML, CSS,

            <h3>cceptance of Work</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Quotations are valid for 30 days from date of issue.</li>
                <li>When the Client places an order to purchase a website or website updates from the Developer,
                    the order represents an offer to the Developer to purchase the website or website updates. No
                    contract for the supply of services exists between Client and Developer until the Developer sends
                    an invoice to the Client for payment. The invoice equals acceptance by the Developer
                    (or third party supplier) of the Client's offer to purchase services from the Developer and this
                    acceptance of work is a valid contract between Client and Developer regardless of whether the Client
                    receives the invoice.
                </li>
                <li>Any other services on the order that have not been included in the invoice do not form part of the
                    contract. The Client agrees to check that the details of the invoice are correct and should print
                    and keep a copy for their records.
                </li>
                <li>The Developer is liable to withdraw the from contract at any time prior to acceptance.
                </li>
                <li>Additional work requested by the Client that is not specified in the agreed quotation is subject to
                    an additional quotation by the Developer on receipt of specification. If the work is needed as part
                    of an existing project, then this may affect time scale and overall delivery time of the project.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a functional specification and a set of testing criteria is included within the quotation, the
                    Developer is responsible for fulfilling the testing criteria as the sole criteria for completion of
                    the contract.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Client agrees that the standard development platform is an agreeable platform for development
                    of the website and all acceptance testing will occur only on the standard development platform. The
                    Client further agrees that any requests relating to hardware or software outside the standard
                    development platform will be deemed additional work.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Client agrees to provide any needed information and content required by the Developer in good
                    time to enable the Developer to complete a design or website work as part of an agreed project.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any work is subject to a minimum charge of &pound;90.

                Copyright of the completed web designs, images, pages, code and source files created by the Developer
                for the project shall be with the Client upon final payment only by prior written agreement. Without
                agreement, ownership of designs and all code is with the Developer.

            <li>
                These terms of use grant a non-exclusive limited license so that the Client can use the design on one
                website on one domain name only. The Client is not permitted to use a design for more than one website
                without prior written agreement between the Client and the Developer.
            </li>
            <li>

                project are either owned by the Client or used with full permission of the original authors. The Client
                agrees to hold harmless, protect and defend the Developer from any claim or suit that may arise as a
                result of using the supplied media and content.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Client agrees that the Developer may include development credits and links within any code the
                Developer designs, builds or amends. If the Developer designs a website for a Client, then the Client
                agrees that the Developer may include a development credit and link displayed on the Client's website.
                If the Developer builds or amends a website for a Client, then the Client agrees that the Developer may
                include a development credit and link displayed on the Client's web page, which may be within the code
                but not displayed on a web browser if requested by the Client.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Client agrees that the Developer reserves the right to include any work done for the Client in a
                portfolio of work.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Client agrees to abide by the terms of any third party software or media included within any work
                done for the Client. Examples of this include, but are not limited to, Google Maps, Media under the

                </li>
                <li>
                    The Client agrees that registration of a domain name does not provide endorsement of the right to
                    use the name. The Client is responsible for ensuring they have due title to the domain name.
                    The Developer holds no liability and the Client hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
                    Developer from any claim resulting from the Client's registration of a domain name.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The domain name is registered in the Client's own name, with the address and contact details of the
                    Developer. The Client should be aware that a domain name is registered with a third party and as
                    such the Client shall agree to fully abide by the terms and conditions set out by the third party
                    for such services.

                <li>
                    The Client agrees to take all legal responsibility for use of third party domain name and hosting
                    services and supply truthful details to the third party services.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Client agrees that information submitted for registration of domain names is then available to
                    the general public via the Nominet Whois system. However, Clients who are using their website for
                    non-trading purposes may ask the third party registrar for their contact information not to be
                    included in the Nominet Whois system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Client is liable to pay the Developer for any domain name registrations and the initial set-up

                    name renewals, hosting charges, yearly hosting renewals, hosting upgrades, extra disk space,
                    bandwidth and any other related or hidden charges, are to be paid by the Client to the third party

                <li>
                    The Client agrees to pay the domain name and hosting fees as soon as required by the third party.
                    Any modifications needed to the domain name or hosting services are to be made between the Client
                    and third party service.

                <li>
                    The Client agrees that if at any time their contact details, including email address, change, it is
                    their responsibility to contact the third party and update their contact details. Failure to do so
                    may mean that renewal invoices for the domain name and hosting services are not received by the
                    Client.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Payment for domain name and hosting services is to be made immediately on receipt of an invoice from
                    the third party service. Failure to comply with the payment terms may result in the Client's domain
                    name becoming available to another party and/or the website and email services becoming unavailable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Client agrees to pass on FTP details and any other access details relating to their domain name
                    and hosting account that the Developer requires to upload the website if required as part of a
                    project.

                    The Developer reserves the right without notice to cancel, reject or refuse work with domain names

                    The Client agrees to be liable for their use of the domain name, hosting and email services with
                    the third party and hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Developer from any claim
                    resulting from the Client's publication of material and use of the domain name, hosting and
                    email services.

                    The Client agrees to take full responsibility for all usage of the domain name, hosting and email

        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The Client agrees that an HTML page built from a graphic design may not exactly match the original
                design because of the difference between the display in design software and the rendering of HTML code
                by Internet browser software. The Developer agrees to try to match the design as closely as is possible
                when building the code.
            </li>
            <li>
                During a website project it is important that the Client communicates information to the Developer to
                achieve the required result.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Client agrees they are permitted a maximum of 4 hours of alteration on projects of &pound;3000,
                with an additional 1 hour of alteration available per whole &pound;1500 of cost after that, unless
                quoted otherwise. All alterations are to be requested in writing either by email or postal mail by
                the Client. After the allocated time for alterations is used up, either in design or coding, the
                Developer reserves the right to advise the Client of such and send a separate quotation to the
                Client and to request payment for any further alterations. The Developer reserves the right to request
                payment be received for further alterations before continuing work. Upon completion of agreed design,
                the Client is asked to confirm in writing by email or postal mail that the design and the screen size
                is signed off as complete and agree that any further design alterations are chargeable.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the Client requests design or content alterations to pages that have already been completed, new
                pages or different functionality other than that specified in the original quotation, the Developer
                reserves the right to quote separately for these alterations.
            </li>
            <li>
                If optimised pages are included as part of the project, the Developer will optimise the Client's web
                pages that already make up part of the project. Optimised pages is not creation of new pages. The
                optimisation of the web pages can include the meta tags, keywords, description, title, alternative
                text and other text provided by the Client.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Developer endeavours to create pages that are accessible to search engines. However, the Developer
                gives no guarantee that the site will become listed with search engines
            </li>
            <li>
                If an error or issue with the design or code arises during the project, which does not allow the design
                or code to match the original specification, then the Client agrees that the Developer can apply a
                nearest available alternative solution.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Developer at all times applies reasonable skill and care in provision of services.
            </li>
            <li>
                On request, the Developer can create a copy of the website on one CD to be posted to the Client on
                project completion. A small charge will be made to cover the cost of this, unless quoted otherwise.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the project is completed, the Developer will upload the website to the Client's live web address
                if included as part of a project.
            </li>
            <li>
                After site completion, a Client or a third party of their choosing may wish to edit their website code
                themselves to make updates. However, the Client agrees that in so doing they assume full responsibility
                for any issues which occur as a result of changing the code themselves. If the Client or a third party
                of their choosing edits the website code and this results in functionality errors or the page displaying
                incorrectly, then the Developer reserves the right to quote for work to repair the website.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Developer reserves the right to assign subcontractors in whole or as part of a project if needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Developer will keep a copy of the site and design source files when a website project is being
                worked on. However, the Client agrees that it is their responsibility to have regular backups made by
                themselves or the third party hosting services in case of a software or hardware failure at the third
                party hosting servers.
            </li>
            <li>
                All communications between Developer and Client shall be by telephone, email, Skype or postal mail,
                except where agreed at the Developer's discretion.

        <h3>Accessibility &amp; Web Standards</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The Developer tests sites and templates to ensure they comply with WAI accessibility standards to Level
                A conformance at time of sale. Should the Client request that the Developer alter the site or templates
                to meet specific WAI accessibility guidelines, or if updated WAI accessibility guidelines were
                introduced after the site or templates were sold to the Client, the Developer reserves the right to
                quote separately for any additional work needed. If the Client uses CMS Themes or Modules, or other
                CMS systems that are not built by the Developer, the overall page may not meet WAI accessibility
                standards to Level A conformance.

                The Developer shall make every effort to ensure sites are designed to be viewed by the majority of
                visitors. Sites are designed to work with the standard development platform, which includes recent
                versions of the main browsers, Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. The Client agrees that the
                Developer cannot guarantee correct functionality with all browser software across different operating
                systems.
            </li>

                Firefox, domain name set-up changes or hosting set-up changes thereafter may affect the functionality
                and display of their website. As such, the Developer reserves the right to quote for any work involved
                in changing the website design or website code for it to work with updated browser software, domain name
                or hosting changes.

            <li>
                The Client agrees that more advanced applications on a website page may require a newer browser version

                The Developer endeavours to provide a website within given delivery time scales to the best of its ability.
                However, the Client agrees that the Developer is not liable for any claims, losses, costs incurred or
                compensation due to any failure to carry out services within a given delivery time scale.

                On handover of files from Developer to Client, the Client shall assume entire responsibility in ensuring
                that all files are functioning correctly before use. Whilst every effort is made to make sure files are
                error free, the Developer cannot guarantee that the display or functionality of the web design or the
                website will be uninterrupted or error free. If, after handover of files, errors are found in code the
                Developer has created and the standard development platform, domain name set-up and hosting set-up are
                the same as when work began, then the Developer can correct these errors for the Client free of charge
                for a period of 3 months, after acceptance of the work. After the 3-month period, the Developer reserves
                the right to quote separately for any work involved in correcting an error.
