            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Our process has been engineered to ensure it focuses on all stakeholders needs and ensures they feel
                a part of the collaboration team.

            <h2>Methodologies</h2>
            <p>
                Using full-cycle development means everyone takes responsibility for the project. Starting with idea
                elaboration, system specifications and user experience design we follow the latest industry standards
                and practices to guarantee that our clients get something unique and effective. Something that grows
                their business and brings it to a whole new level.

                <h3>Agile</h3>
                <p>
                    We utilise Agile methodologies to optimise team efficiency to ensure communication, staffing,
                    resource assignment and reporting are all completed effectively.

        <h3>Continuous Integration</h3>
        <p>
            Modern applications and software needs updating and tweaking to adapt to the ever changing environment.
            Because integration takes place so frequently, in continuous integration there is significantly less
            back-tracking to discover where things went wrong, so you can spend more time building features.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we didn't follow a continuous approach, we would have longer periods between integrations this would
            make it exponentially more difficult to find and fix problems. Such integration problems can easily knock
            a project off-schedule, or cause it to fail altogether.

                    Our Quality Assurance team carries out intense tests on each project from the beginning to ensure
                    that the solution works smoothly, looks simple yet intuitively meets all the specified and agreed
                    requirements.
